                    Hi, I'm <br> Prosper Raheem
                </h2>

                <p>
                    I'm a self taught game developer who is adept with LUA and Python programming languages as well as HTML, 
                    CSS and Javascript. I enjoy learning about new and interesting concepts in the ever changing field of 
                    Computer Science and aspire to become a software developer / engineer, but more specifically would pursue a career
                    in full stack development. I am now actively enhancing proficiency in more in-demand programming languages like 
                    Java and C++. Also, currently looking to gain valuable experiences in the corporate world / workplace settings
                    relating to my keen interest in programming!
                </p>
